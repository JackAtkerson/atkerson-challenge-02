## Challenge 2

## Made With 
* HTML
* CSS

## Process
I started this challenge by drawing a mockup of the site I wanted on paper. After that I began writing basic HTML to get the header and section titles made.
Then I focused on the nav bar, and making the links direct you to their respective sections. Then I made the "About Me" section and embedded my resume as a PDF
in its own section. I had a lot of trouble formatting the "Work" section, I could not get the images to the size or position I wanted. I eventually got something
I was ok with. I am going to study up on HTML, CSS, and the flexbox to get a handle on that. I learned a lot from my successes, and even more form my mistakes.
